# LLC Formation Checklist

*mirrored at [varia.law/llc](https://varia.law/llc)*

## Name
- [ ] Choose a name 
    - search the applicable state's corporate directory for availability (for example, [DE's Division of Corp. Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx))
    - search federal and state trademark databases for conflicts ([USPTO search](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/search/search-information))
- [ ] `State-specific` ensure your chosen name complies with state law
    - many states require "LLC", "L.L.C.", or "Ltd." as a suffix for your entity name, and there are usually restrictions on certain sensitive or materially misleading names (for example, a carpentry business probably should not be named "Cardiac Surgeons LLC")
    - some states require forming a "professional LLC" (PLLC) for certain types of licensed professions, such as law, accounting, engineering, architecture, or medicine
    - consider if you'll later file for a "doing business as" (d/b/a) name, which may not require a suffix (for example, Varia Law)

## Licensing and Formation
- [ ] `State-specific` check whether any professional licensing is required for your operation 
- [ ] `Local-specific` check whether any licenses or permits are needed for your LLC's operation
    - licensed business types or activities
    - building permits
    - zoning
- [ ] `State-specific` file the necessary formation documents, or consider using a corporate service company for formation of the entity, registered agent, and state filings (including payment of annual fees and handling annual reports). 
    - popular choices include doola, Zenbusiness, LegalZoom, etc.
    - such services may also assist in any d/b/a filings, annual property filings, etc.
- [ ] `State-specific` ask your lawyer whether the registered agent's address may be used as the LLC's address
    - some states require the primary address where your business is conducted (which for many SMLLCs might be a home address)
- [ ] `State-specific` have your lawyer draft an LLC Operating Agreement, even for a single-member LLC
    - governs ownership, management, and succession
    - for multi-member LLCs, include capital contributions, distributions, and buyout provisions
    - for special-purpose LLCs (e.g., real estate), tailored to that purpose

## Finances and Accounts 
- [ ] Open a bank account for your LLC 
- [ ] Get a credit card for your LLC
- [ ] Purchase business/professional insurance for your LLC
- [ ] Register domains and service accounts for your LLC
    - website domain and hosting (if applicable), 
    - email address (with LLC's domain, or another handle in your existing email provider), and 
    - social media handles (LinkedIn, X, Google Business Profile, etc.)
    - payment processor or merchant of record
    - anything other services you'll use for your LLC's business specifically (GitHub, , etc.)
    - update personal professional profiles
    - organize LLC-specific records and storage
- [ ] If accepting crypto, consider an exchange account for your LLC
    - also consider further ways to distinguish and separate your LLC crypto income/assets from personal assets, for example an ENS for your LLC's EOA/multi-sig that includes your LLC's name 
    - keep a private Confirmation of Accounts document with your LLC's address(es) and other accounts
- [ ] Consider using bookkeeping software to keep track of income and expenses, and calculate estimated federal quarterly taxes. 
    - options such as Quickbooks will provide aggregated forms for annual tax filings

## Taxes, Retirement, Compliance
- [ ] If applicable, apply for an [EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).
- [ ] Consider an [EFTPS](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/) account for paying quarterly estimated federal tax payments online from your LLC's bank account
- [ ] `Foreign-specific` Foreign LLCs (formed outside the U.S. but registered to do business in the U.S.) must comply with [FinCEN BOI filing](https://www.fincen.gov/boi) requirements unless otherwise exempt
- [ ] `State-specific` each state has its own system for paying quarterly estimated state taxes.
    - schedule estimated amount payments in advance for a taxable year, with the option to auto-withdraw from your LLC's bank account (make a note of these payment dates)
- [ ] If you plan on hiring employees or operating as an S-corp, consider a payroll and HR service such as Gusto, Rippling, etc.
- [ ] Consider a retirement account for your LLC like a SEP-IRA, Sole 401(k), or Simple IRA, depending on employees, income level, and desired flexibility. Consult a CPA or lawyer.
- [ ] Consult a CPA for annual tax filings/payments and any other tax, retirement, or other accounting concerns
    - for example, whether a single-member LLC should be taxed as a pass-through (most common) or a corporation (and if so, handling IRS form 8832 and other necessary payment flows and administrative tasks)
    - franchise, property, excise, sales, and other tax considerations
- [ ] Consult a lawyer for:
    - contracts your LLC may enter into, including any client-facing forms or terms (your lawyer should be involved any time a contract is signed)
    - any litigation activity (obviously)
    - IP protections, such as copyright or trademark filings for your LLC's name, logo, or patents if applicable
    - privacy and data-handling compliance if applicable
    - any other legal or regulatory concerns, including questions about LLCs
